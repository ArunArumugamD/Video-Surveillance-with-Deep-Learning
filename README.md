# Video-Surveillance-with-Deep-Learning

In this deep learning project, we train an autoencoder for abnormal event detection. We train the autoencoder on normal videos. We identify the abnormal events based on the euclidean distance of the custom video feed and the frames predicted by the autoencoder.

We set a threshold value for abnormal events. In this project, it is 0.0068; you can vary this threshold to experiment getting better results.
